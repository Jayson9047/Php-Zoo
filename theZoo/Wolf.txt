The wolf (Canis lupus), also known as the gray/grey wolf, is a 
canine native to the wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and 
North America. It is the largest extant member of its family, with 
males averaging 43-45 kg (95-99 lb) and females 36-38.5 kg (79-85 lb). 
It is distinguished from other Canis species by its larger size and less 
pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter fur is 
long and bushy and predominantly a mottled gray in colour, although nearly 
pure white, red and brown to black also occur
