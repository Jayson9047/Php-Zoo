Peafowl is a common name for three species of birds in the genera Pavo 
and Afropavo of the Phasianidae family, the pheasants and their allies. 
Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl as peahens.
The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally of the 
Indian subcontinent, and the green peafowl of Southeast Asia; the one 
African species is the Congo peafowl, native only to the Congo Basin. Male 
peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage. 
The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, which have an 
eye-spotted "tail" or "train" of covert feathers, which they display as 
part of a courtship ritual.
