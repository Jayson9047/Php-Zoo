Elephants, the largest existing land animals, are mammals of the family 
Elephantidae. Three species are currently recognised: the African bush 
elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephantidae
is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; extinct members 
include the mastodons. The family Elephantidae also contains several 
now-extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants. 
African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian 
elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. Distinctive 
features of all elephants include a long trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, 
massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk, also called a 
proboscis, is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and 
grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve 
both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear 
flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in 
communication. The pillar-like legs carry their great weight.
